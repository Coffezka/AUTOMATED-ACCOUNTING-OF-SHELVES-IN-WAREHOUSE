# About project

Development of software for optical analysis and accounting for the presence of materials in the package.
The task is to analyze images from multiple cameras that monitor multiple shelves by removing or delivering packages of materials. When picking up from the shelf or delivering to the shelf, the system must track the movement, ie show the remains of materials in digital format online. That is to make the automated warehouse accounting of a rack.
